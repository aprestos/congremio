## 📋 Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Use **strict mode** - all strict flags enabled
- Provide **explicit return types** for all functions
- Use `interface` over `type` for object shapes
- Avoid `any` - use `unknown` or proper types instead

### Vue 3 Component Guidelines
- Use **Composition API** with `<script setup lang="ts">` exclusively
- Define **typed props** and **emits** explicitly
- Use `ref` with explicit types: `const count = ref<number>(0)`
- Follow PascalCase for component names
- Order: imports → props → emits → refs → computed → methods → lifecycle hooks

### File Naming Conventions
- **Components**: PascalCase (`UserProfile.vue`)
- **Composables**: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useSearch.ts`)
- **Stores**: camelCase with `.store.ts` suffix (`tenant.store.ts`)
- **Utils**: camelCase (`fileUpload.ts`)
- **Types/Models**: camelCase with `.model.ts` or `.entity.ts` suffix

### Styling
- Use **Tailwind CSS** utilities primarily
- Support light and dark modes via `dark:` variants
- Use custom color scales: `primary`, `surface`, `highlight`
- Minimal custom CSS - prefer Tailwind utilities

## 🔄 Workflow

### Before Committing

1. **Format code:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run format
   ```

2. **Lint code:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run lint
   ```

3. **Type check:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run type-check
   ```

4. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run test:unit
   ```

5. **Create commit** with conventional commit message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   ```

Git hooks (husky) will automatically validate commits.

## 🌐 Deployment

### Build for Production
```bash
pnpm run build
```

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
# Connect your repository to Vercel
# The build command will automatically run: pnpm run build
# Output directory: dist
```

### Environment Variables (Production)
Set the following in your hosting platform:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
